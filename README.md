## Overview 

The purpose of this repository is to document my hands-on experience with designing, maintaining, and simulating attacks in a Homelab SOC. 
Built on Proxmox, the lab brings together multiple open-source tools to emulate the workflows and challenges of an enterprise-grade Security Operations Center.

**Tools Included:**

**Proxmox** - (Host) Virtualization Software. 

**Wazuh** - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) / Extended Detection Response (XDR). 

**Ubuntu Server** - (Host) SIEM / XDR Software.

**Macbook** - Generate Daily Workflow Logs.
